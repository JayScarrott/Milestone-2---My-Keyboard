# My Kyyboard
The idea for this website is to create a fun and interactive way to learn about pianos and keyboards, as well as a bit of music theory in general.

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion

When I first had the idea of creating an interactive keyboard, I didn't really think much of it, but when having a planning meeting with my tutor, Graeme Taylor, he was very fond of the idea, and said it was a unique idea with a lot of potential.

Graeme pointed out very quickly that keyboard could be used for educational purposes, but I still wanted it to be used for fun and creativity as well, Graeme then pointed out that it's possible to do both.


### User Stories

#### Target Audience

The target audience for My Keyboard could be genuinely anyone, I believe. Maybe they've got a few minutes to kill and want to mess about on a keyboard, maybe they're curious about music, and this is a good entry point.

#### Client Goals

* Accessible introduction to music
* 

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* An accessible way to learn about the notes on a piano
* Have fun messing around with the keyboard

#### Returning Visitor Goals
